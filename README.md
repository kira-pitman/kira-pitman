### Kia ora, I'm Kira üåª

- I come from an experimental physics background, and have done a recent pivot into web development via Dev Academy Aotearoa!
- I've just finished my website development bootcamp, and I'm on a mission to make technology both accessible and meaningful!
- I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge of react, javascript, three.js, and authentication in full-stack development!
- I'm looking to branch out into encryption, Rust, and embedded electronics in the near future!

If you want to discuss new tech, collaborate, or connect, I'm all ears - reach out and let's chat! ‚òÄÔ∏è
